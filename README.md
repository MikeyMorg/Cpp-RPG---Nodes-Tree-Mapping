# Cpp-RPG---Nodes-Tree-Mapping
This algorithm makes a text-based RPG out of a .txt file that follows a format of "int | string | int | int", where the order is the event number, the event description, then the left child index and the right child index, respectively. Instead of binary, I want child nodes to have multiple parent nodes. so I utilized unordered map to store my sorted nodes, and then used a loop to assign each node with their corresponding child nodes based on their index.
